# Sign_Language_detection
This Project is completed as apart of the IOD Data Science Boot Camp.

The objective of this project is to develop a robust sign language detection system using deep learning algorithms, specifically leveraging LSTM.It is to accurately identify and translate live human actions into sign language, considering the movements of joints, elbows, and facial expressions.Its used to enhance real-time communication for the speech and hearing impaired, contributing to their inclusion and accessibility.
